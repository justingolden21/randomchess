### What is This?

Random Chess. Both sides make a purely random move. Given all possible moves, they choose one at random.

### Features

- Choose the move speed and whether to start a new game after the previous one is finished

- Track the result of each game

### When the Game Ends

In addition to white or black checkmating, there are several ways to draw a game:

- Insufficient material: There are insufficient pieces left for a checkmate to be possible
- Stalemate: A player is not in check and has no moves
- Threefold repetiton: the exact same board state has occured three times in a row
- 50 move rule: If there have been no captures made and no pawns moved in 50 moves, it is also considered a draw

For more on insufficient material, go here: http://www.e4ec.org/immr.html

### Stats

I've noticed that about 70-80% of games end in draws, mostly insufficient material and 50 move rule.

Longest Draw: 668 moves (insufficient material)
Longest Checkmate: 287 moves
Shortest Draw: 133 moves
Shortest Checkmate: 8 moves (second place: 54 moves)
